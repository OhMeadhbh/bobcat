    <h1>Bobcat : Pleasant Pages for Lynx</h1>

    <p>Last updated January 16th, 2025.</p>
    
    <h2>Orientation</h2>

    <p>
      BOBCAT is a simple site that catalogs other sites that look good when rendered with text-oriented browsers such as <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">Lynx</a> or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eww.html">Emacs' Web Wowser</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're reading this page with Lynx, I suggest using the arrow, tab or shift-tab keystrokes to change which link is highlighted.
      When a link you're interested in is highlighted, press &lt;enter&gt; to visit the site or press 'a', then 'l' to save the link to your bookmarks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Emacs' <strong>EWW</strong> mode operates similarly (arrow, tab and shift-tab change which link is highlighted.)
      When a link you're interested in is highlighted, press &lt;enter&gt; to visit the site or press 'b' to save the link to your bookmarks.

    <h2>Search Engines</h2>

      <dt><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/lite/">Duck Duck Go Search</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        The good people at DuckDuckGo maintain a low complexity site that's easy to use and has zero cruft.

    <h2>News Sites</h2>

    <dl>

      <dt><a href="https://text.npr.org/">Text-Only NPR.org</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        NPR maintains a "thin" version of their site which works well with text-based browsers.
      </p></dd>
      
      <dt><a href="http://lite.cnn.com/en">CNN Headlines</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        This is the "lite" version of the CNN web page.
        I bet it was created for older mobile devices, but it renders <strong>beautifully</strong> with Lynx and doesn't bombard you with ads.
      </p></dd>

      <dt><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/news">CBC Lite News</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        A pleasantly rendered news feed from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. 
      </p></dd>

<!-- Removing 68k.news due to numerous problems with TLS certificates
     and now it seems like outbound links just simply fail. -->

      <dt><a href="https://68k.news">68k.news : Headlines from the Future</a></dt>

      <dd>
        68k.news maintains a text-friendly mirror into the US edition of the Google News.
        The cert on the site is borked, but that ties in with the retrocomputing theme.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        If you're unfamiliar with Hacker News, it's like the SlashDot of old, but with a simplified landing page and slightly less drama.
        Sadly, the search function only works with JavaScript enabled, so neither Lynx nor EWW work with it.

      <dt><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/text/textedition">The Christian Science Monitor / Text</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        The CSM is a well-regarded news source in North America.
        Despite being named after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Science">Christian Science</a> religious movement founded by Mary Baker Eddy, it does not seem to evangelize and does not approach news stories from a religious viewpoint.
        It does, however, provide a very nice "lite" site which renders well in Lynx and EWW.
      </p></dd>
      
      <dt><a href="https://lite.pbs.org/">PBS : Public Broadcasting Service</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        It seems weird to include a site which links primarily to video resources, but the meta-data and video descriptions render well.
        Perhaps in the future a tool like <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a> or <a href="https://mpv.io/">mvp</a> could consume <em>pbs.org</em> video URLs and save or display them in the terminal.
      </p></dd>

      <dt><a href="https://lite.poandpo.com/">POST Online Media (lite version)</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        This is the "lite" version of the main <a href="https://www.poandpo.com/">poandpo.com</a> site.
        I don't know much about this organization, but like that they have several <a href="https://lite.poandpo.com/home/rss">RSS feeds</a>.
      </p></dd>

      <dt><a href="https://text.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch (text version)</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        In their own words, HRW "investigates and reports on abuses happening in all corners of the world."
        The politics of civil rights abuses can be controversial in some corners of the Internet.
        But I include it on this list because it renders well without JavaScript and in a text-only browser.

      <dt><a href="https://lobste.rs/">Lobsters</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        "Lobsters is a computing-focused community centered around link aggregation and discussion."
        It's also the home of a pleasant and informed community.
        Posting a comment via Lynx or EWW is hit-or-miss, but browsing comments seems to work.
      </p></dd>

      <dt><a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">The Digital Services Playbook</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        From the U.S. Digital Services, the playbook lists thirteen key "plays" describing successful "Best Common Practices."
      </p></dd>

      <dt><a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">World Wide Web (The Project)</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        This is the world's first web page, archived at CERN and is delightfully spartan.
      </p></dd>

      <dt><a href="https://wttr.in/">Text Weather Report</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        This is kind of nice.
        It looks like it's using IP geolocation to give you a regional, text-based weather forecast.
        It doesn't render well in Lynx unless your terminal is 127 or more columns wide, but renders fine in EWW.

      <dd><p>
        This is a site similar to Bobcat.
        It lists a few sites that work well in text-only browsers.
        Some of the entries seem to be a bit dated, however.
      </p></dd>

      <dt><a href="http://localhost/~msh/bobcat/">Bobcat</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        Self-reference is not so vile a sin as self-neglect.
        Including this site for completeness.

    <h2>Entertainment</h2>

    <dl>

      <dt><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/textbased/channel-561/index.html">Daily Mail Online (lite version)</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        For people who like their news with a dash of infotainment, the Daily Mail provides a lite version of the day's events.
        The text-based rendering isn't the best, you have to tab past quite a few topic headings before reaching the list of articles.
        But articles seem to be rendered well once you get to them.

      <dt><a href="https://meadhbh.hamrick.rocks/">My Home Page</a></dt>

      <dd><p>
        Of course my home page is going to be pleasant to look at with lynx.
        I have some technical writings and fiction I wrote.
        It's fun, if you're into that kind of thing.
