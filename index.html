        This is the "lite" version of the CNN web page.
        I bet it was created for older mobile devices,
        but it renders <strong>beautifully</strong> with
        Lynx and doesn't bombard you with ads.

        The good people at DuckDuckGo maintain a low
        complexity site that's easy to use and has
        zero cruft.
