    <p>
      BOBCAT is a simple site that catalogs other sites
      that look good when rendered as text with
      <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">the
        Lynx Web Browser</a>.      
    </p>

    <p>
      Below is a list of web site which are usable by
      Lynx users. Simply scroll down until you see
      something interesting and either press
      &lt;enter&gt; to visit the site or press 'a', then

    <h2>The Catalog</h2>

      <dt><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/lite/">Duck
        Duck Go Search</a></dt>
      
      <dd>
        The good people at DuckDuckGo maintain a low
        complexity site that's easy to use and has
        zero cruft.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="https://text.npr.org/">Text-Only
        NPR.org</a></dt>

      <dd>
        NPR maintains a "thin" version of their site
        which works well with text-based browsers.
      </dd>
      
      <dt><a href="http://lite.cnn.com/en">CNN
        Headlines</a></dt>
      
      <dd>
        This is the "lite" version of the CNN web page.
        I bet it was created for older mobile devices,
        but it renders <strong>beautifully</strong> with
        Lynx and doesn't bombard you with ads.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="https://68k.news">68k.news :
        Headlines from the Future</a></dt>
      <dd>
        
        68k.news maintains a text-friendly mirror into
        the US edition of the Google News. The cert on
        the site is borked, but that ties in with the
        retrocomputing theme.
        
      </dd>
      
      <dt><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker
        News</a></dt>

      <dd>

        If you're unfamiliar with Hacker News, it's
        rather like the SlashDot of old, but with a
        greatly simplified landing page and slightly
        less drama.
        
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="https://lobste.rs/">Lobsters</a></dt>

      <dd>

        "Lobsters is a computing-focused community
        centered around link aggregation and discussion."
        It's also the home of a pleasant and informed
        community.
        
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">The Digital
        Services Playbook</a></dt>

      <dd>

        From the U.S. Digital Services, the playbook
        lists thirteen key "plays" describing successful
        "Best Common Practices."

      </dd>

      <dt><a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">World
        Wide Web (The Project)</a></dt>

      <dd>

        This is the world's first web page, archived at
        CERN and is delightfully spartan.

      </dd>

      <dt><a href="https://meadhbh.hamrick.rocks/">My Home Page</a></dt>

      <dd>

        Of course my home page is going to be pleasant to
        look at with lynx. I have some technical writings
        and fiction I wrote. It's fun, if you're into that
        kind of thing.
