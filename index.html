    <h1>BOBCAT : Pleasant Pages for Lynx</h1>

    <p>
      BOBCAT is a simple site that catalogs other sites
      that look good when rendered as text with
      <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">the
        Lynx Web Browser</a>.      
    </p>

    <h2>The Catalog</h2>

        This is the "lite" version of the CNN web page.
        I bet it was created for older mobile devices,
        but it renders <strong>beautifully</strong> with
        Lynx and doesn't bombard you with ads.

        The good people at DuckDuckGo maintain a low
        complexity site that's easy to use and has
        zero cruft.
