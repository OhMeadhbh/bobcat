BOBCAT : Pleasant Pages for Lynx

Hi.   You've  found   the   GitHub   project  site   for
BOBCAT. This project  is *really* just a  bunch of HTML,
so you probably just want to point your browser at:

  https://ohmeadhbh.github.io/bobcat

There's nothing  here to build,  it's just HTML.  If you
want to  suggest a  change to the  site, you  can either
open and issue (click on the issues tab above) or fork
it, change it and send me a pull request.
