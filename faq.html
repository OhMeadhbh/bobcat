      <dt>1. Why would you waste your time on this?</dt>

        I guess I live in a fantasy land of my own
        creation. In my world, it is perpetually 1987 and
        I spend the majority of my time on a VT240
        terminal writing development tools for VMS. At
        night I watch "Space : 1999" reruns and write
        games in assembly language for 16 bit DOS
        systems.

        I enjoy using Lynx. It strips away the cruft of
        the web. I have never seen a pop-up add using
        a text based browser. There's just too few people
        using Lynx to make it profitable. But the flip
        side of that is there are <em>very</em> few web
        pages optimized to look good to a text based
        browser.

        And that's why I'm doing this: to share a few
        sites that are pleasant to look at when using an
        old, text-based browser.
