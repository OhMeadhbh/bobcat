    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <dt>1. Why would you waste your time on this?</dt>

      <dd><p>
        I guess I live in a fantasy land of my own creation.
        In my world, it is perpetually 1987 and I spend the majority of my time on a VT240 terminal writing development tools for VMS.
        At night I watch "Space : 1999" reruns and write games in assembly language for 16 bit DOS systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy using Lynx.
        It strips away the cruft of the modern web.
        I have never seen a pop-up add using a text based browser.
        There are just too few people using Lynx to make it profitable.
        But the flip side of that is there are <em>very</em> few web pages optimized to look good to a text based browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that's why I'm doing this: to share a few sites that are pleasant to look at when using an old, text-based browser.

      <dt>2. Cool! I Want to Add A Page!</dt>

      <dd><p>
        Great! Fork this project on <a href="https://github.com/OhMeadhbh/bobcat">GitHub</a>, make some changes and send me a pull request.
      </p></dd>

      <dt>3. Why would I mention Video players like <strong>mpv</strong>?</dt>

      <dd><p>
        Sure, it seems a bit weird at first, but if your terminal supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel">sixel graphics</a> you can convince the <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a> video player to render video to the terminal with a (*nix) command like this:
      </p>

      <pre>      mpv --no-config --vo=sixel --profile=sw-fast --really-quiet \
          --vo-sixel-reqcolors=0 --ao='pulse' &lt;video file&gt;</pre>

      <p>
        Who knew?
